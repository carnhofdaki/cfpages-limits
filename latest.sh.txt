# This is a shell script which downloads all the files
# one by one and joins them to the original latest.zip
# for which Stepan's signature of checksum is made.
#
# For a more advanced example which is decompressing
# the ZIP file on the fly using bsdtar which comes from
# libarchive-tools, see bsdtar.sh.txt and note that
# no signature or checksum verification is being done
# there as it all extracts on the fly and does not leave
# a file to verify. Use bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo muhash
# while having coinstatsindex enabled (the results differ)
# to check these data are valid. BTW it would not make
# sense to distribute anything alsa but valid Bitcoin data.
#
# Requirements: wget, cat, rm, sha256sum, grep, ln, gpgv
